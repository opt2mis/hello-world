> I am 51 year old male living in Montreal, QC, Canada.  I was originally born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia to my loving parents Sarah Lloyd and Bruce Belliveau.  When I turned 20 my adventures on discovering Canada came alive and I would not call Nova Scotia my home no longer, as I spent the next 15 years living in every province in Canada, except Manitoba. When I was 28 while living in Calgary, Alberta I discovered my inner self and proudly came out as a gay male to my family and close friends.  The discovery was definitely scarey at first but soon after the warmth, love and acceptence I felt from my peers is moments I cherish and hold on too forever.  Never once was I made to feel different or an outcast as I was so lead to believe in my thoughts prior to coming out.
